## A bit about me

HejðŸ‘‹  
My name is Lukas Nagel and I am a software engineer from Bavaria, Germany. I also call myself LNA-DEV here and there on the web. On this page, I want to introduce myself a bit.

### FOSS

I am involved in a few [FOSS projects](../projects/) in my free time here and there. This is one of my main interests: building free and open-source software.

I believe in the open model and think that open-source projects solve many problems a commercial actor could never achieve. I use Linux on every device and also use nearly only FOSS. I will make a few posts about the software I use, how to use it and why this is so important.

### Privacy

In my opinion, this topic goes hand in hand with FOSS. Everyone should have the right to choose with whom to share data. And no shady ad company should be able to exploit their near monopoly to harvest data like it would be theirs. I try to use privacy friendly tools and encourage others to do so as well.

### Indie Web

I am increasingly getting into the Indie Web. I am at the beginning of this journey, but I like the principles and think they provide a viable way for the future.

### Photography

Another hobby of mine is photography. I have a page solely for that: [LNA-DEV Gallery](https://photo.lna-dev.net). If you are interested, go and check it out. My photography is published under a permissive license, so if you want to use them, you can if you fulfill the license. (You can find the license information at the bottom of my [photography site](https://photo.lna-dev.net).)

I take photographs in many different categories (like landscapes, animals, and plants). But I also want to get into a few more areas like portrait photography.

I edit my photography using [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/), a free and open-source photo editing and management program. It is a bit like Lightroom but completely free in terms of money but also in terms of freedom.
