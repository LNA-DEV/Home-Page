## General

In this post I want to join [exurb1a](https://www.youtube.com/c/Exurb1a) on his statement about privacy and the importance 
of it in our day-to-day life. And much more important than this I want to showcase how to do it better. For this I will 
create posts about **Privacy Tools** and **Privacy** in general from time to time.

## Prerequisites

This post is based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzhkwyoe5vI) video. I **highly** recommend watching it. It 
is a 10 out of 10 video about modern privacy.

## Why should I care about privacy?

If you say: "I like the amount of privacy I have right now" than you lay the first stones of a more privacy invading 
future. **The way we do the things today shapes... no... determines the future!**  

If it is ok today than tomorrow it will be not. So in my opinion we have to change how we think about privacy.

## What should I do now?

I think the best you can do is staying well-informed to make good decisions. And this is not a thing you do once. It is 
a journey. There are many good sites which showcase good privacy respecting tools. For example 
[PrivacyToolsIo](https://www.privacytools.io/). I also will showcase a couple of nice software I use and recommend.
