I spent the last couple of weeks going threw all my photographs I took in the last two years (and more) and edited my best shots. In this post I want to share what I learned which tools I use and describe my workflow from taking the photos over editing them to publishing them on my webpage and social media. I am no way an expert photographer but I think it might be useful to those who are hobby photographers like me, interested in open source photo editing or just curious.

## In the camera

When I started photographing with my `Panasonic G91` I mostly used the full automatic mode. That is pretty easy but not very optimal in my opinion. After reviewing a couple of images I did during that time I saw that a couple of images had settings that did not make very much sense. The aperture priority mode I tried with this camera made a lot of a difference. In this mode you set the ISO and aperture and the camera automatically determines the appropriate shutter speed. This mode gives you a lot more control over how the image looks like because you set the aperture consciously. I also got a pretty good feeling for in which light conditions which settings where appropriate because I chose two of the tree myself and had a good look at what shutter speed the camera chose.

Sometime this year I got a new `Nikon Z8` which changed a lot for me. I bought three prime lenses instead of a zoom lens which I had with the Panasonic. Those prime lenses force me into being a bit more creative when taking the shot.
