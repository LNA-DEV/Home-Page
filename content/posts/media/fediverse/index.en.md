In this post I want to explain what the Fediverse is and why you should join it. I talk a bit about the technical stuff but this post is intended to be understood by anyone.

## Where does the name come from?

The name is a portmanteau of federation and universe. So the Fediverse is a federated universe.

This name represents it pretty well. The Fediverse is decentral web of social media platforms all connected to each other. Anyone can connect with anybody else even if they are using completely different services. You can imagine it like email. Every user has an email address by a specific service but they can write with anyone they want and not just with users of the same service.

For those who are familiar with the classic social networks: Imagine using Twitter and seeing Instagram or Facebook posts in your timeline just like they would all be using Twitter. That is the Fediverse.

## Why is the Fediverse so important?

### Decentralization

The old social media platforms are owned by companies. Not so is the Fediverse. First of all there are many services in the Fediverse so the whole thing cannot be owned. Just like the internet. So nobody can force the users into something and none can exploit a monopoly.

The creators of the Fediverse platform Peertube explained it in a simple way. Here is their explanation. (This video is by the way hosted on Peertube)

### Free and Open Source

But even the producers of Fediverse software are very different. It consists of mainly FOSS(Free and Open Source Software) which means the software is really free and developers can change things and help improving it. FOSS is incredibly important. It offers so many advantages that I will cover in a future post.

Because of this freedom making money is more challenging. But also the user doesn't get treated like trash. Because the user pays for the Fediverse in terms of donations.

So the software producers of the Fediverse are mainly volunteers or non profit organizations. Both want to make the internet a better place and not just want to make a bug.

But not only the software producers are acting in a fair way also the people who run the servers are mainly volunteers, organizations or even states!

### The force of the masses

Because you can choose your service freely in the Fediverse no one gets excluded from society anymore. I think this is a big issue with the classic social media platforms. I am not using any of these because of all the bad things they do. So I am a bit excluded when it comes to specific contexts. 

This is extremely important when it comes to messangers. There not using the specific service which is popular in your region hits really hard. I personally did not use WhatsApp for a time. I am from Germany and here it is used nearly without exception. A few people have Signal or Threema but thats it. So not having WhatsApp did affect my day to day live hard. I thought that using other services would push a few people to those. It did... But not everyone. So a few friends or family members remained only on WhatsApp. But not only that you can barely communicate with some people you know, like and love, you also have difficulties meeting new people. I had the experiences that some think bad about you if you do not use the service that is common. And of course the barrier of contacting you is much higher if they need to install a new app. And you cannot contact them because you do not have the right messaging app. Of course a social media platform is not a messanger but the effects are pretty much the same: **The people using the big service force you to use it too**

## Current culture in the Fediverse

### Who is in the Fediverse?

## Platforms

In this section I want to showcase a few of the most important services of the Fediverse. **But there are many more to be explored!**

This image shows a quick overview over the different categories and services.

### Mastodon

Mastodon is the biggest and also most developed platform of the Fediverse. It is a microblogging service. The company behind it is a German non profit company (gGmbH). It is comparable with Twitter and gained a lot of attraction during the catastrophic takeover of Elon Musk. At this time there was a huge mass of people moving to Mastodon from Twitter.

After this events on the "freed" platform are even more extreme right wing people and on the other side there are a lot of journalist which get blocked from time to time. If you really want a free platform join Mastodon: <https://joinmastodon.org>  
(They also have a really fancy website: Check it out!)

### Pixelfed

Instagram is really big platform run by Meta which is known for its extremely bad privacy and also had few scandals. For example they helped manipulating elections. See Cambridge Analytica.

Pixelfed is the pardon from the Fediverse for Instagram. It is developed by a Canadian software engineer and the community.

In my opintion it is not as widely developed as Mastodon. But its almost on a perfect level. It has many features. Even some the classical Instagram does not have. But most important it is part of the Fediverse and therefore you could also consume the great photography available on Pixelfed from your Mastodon feed or which other service you like the most.

And of course Pixelfed is devloped as **Free and Open Source Software / FOSS!**

### What about Threads (Meta)?

{{< figure src="./meta-red-carpet.jpg" caption="[ðŸ„¯ CC-BY 4.0 by David Revoy](https://www.davidrevoy.com/)" alt="A little Mastodon is rolling out a red carpet for Meta represented as death / a reaper." >}}

Now bigger companies are starting joining the Fediverse. The biggest is Threads made by Meta.

Currently threads is implementing the required ActivityPub logic to join the network. You can already follow the CEO of Instagram and few of the team. But it seems like the full connection will take a while to implement.

This topic is a controversy in the Fediverse. On one side stands that Meta is bringing a lot of users to the network but on the other side is Meta also well known for incredible bad privacy and being part of the surveillance capitalism.

A few instances even have made the ["Fedi-Pact"](https://fedidb.org/current-events/anti-meta-fedi-pact) and therefore will block Meta on the server side when they are joining. This has an impact of about 7% of active users on the open side of the Fediverse.

If a server does not block a specific other server the user still hast the power to do that. Here the founder of Mastodon explains his audience how that is done.
