## What is Fedodo?

First of all to get everyone on the same level I need to explain what Fedodo is and why I started developing it.  
  
With the rise of [Mastodon]() I became more and more interested in the [ActivityPub]() protocol. I rely like the idea to have a big decentralized platform which can compete with the walled gardens of big tech. The [ActivityPub]() protocol seemed to be just right to achieve that.  
Until now everyone developed a platform for an specific use case. [Mastodon]() as an alternative to Twitter. [Pixelfed]() as an alternative to Instagram. [Lemmy]() as an alternative to Reddit. And the list goes on... I wanted to do this differently. I thought it would not be optimal to develop an ActivityPub-Server for each of these platforms. So my idea was to create an ActivityPub-Server which does not only implement the [ActivityPub server to server]() protocol but also the [ActivityPub client to server]() protocol. This client to server protocol was not rely wide spread at this time. But it would allow anyone to use a frontend of their like with the same server. Also every user needs now just one account. This is possible because Fedodo should have got a feature which allows multiple ActivityPub-Actors per user account.  
As part of Fedodo I wanted to develop not only the server but also a set of frontends. In detail I developed a [Mastodon]() like frontend an was starting to develop a [Pixelfed]() like UI.

## The development

I started developing Fedodo in December 2022. I worked on it a lot until August 2023. So I worked around 8 months on the project. In this time I developed a working server. It might be good to give it a bit more love here and there, write a view tests and fix a view things but all in all is it working grate. In addition to that I had a basic [Mastodon]() like app kind of finished and was on a good way developing the [Pixelfed]() alternative.  
  
For me this sounds grate and is a nice achievement. I even got on a podcast of a big german tech YouTuber and talked about ActivityPub. ([To the episode]())

## What was the Problem?

During the time span of the development I worked for about 380 hours of coding only. In addition to this comes the time I thought about the project and did not have an editor open. This makes about 1 1/2 hours per day coding. Every day in this eight months. Only paid with the german minimum wage this would make up a 4715â‚¬. So a lot of time and effort went into this project.  
  
The problem is I did this in addition to a 40 hours work week. So my total of working hours per week were at about 50 hours.  
  
I rely like coding in my free time. For me that is a hobby. The problem with big projects like Fedodo is that at some point you aren't as hyped on it as in the start. And after some time even a hobby project turns into work. And I think that is the big problem.  
  
If I am working on small projects I am hyped for it doesn't feel like work. But Fedodo did after four to five months. And than the 50 hours per week effect you.  
I would not recommend to anyone doing a project this big. I think everything which you can completely finish in under half a year is fine. But if you have the feeling you do work in your freetime it is not wort it. So kee on doing smaller projects and enjoy the creating.

## How does the future of Fedodo look like?

This feeling of work and personal issues led me to pausing the development of Fedodo and taking a break from coding in my freetime entirely.  
  
It is now a view months later and I slowly start to have those urge again to create something. So I think it was the right decision.  
  
But I will not work on Fedodo this hard again. For a project with the size of Fedodo that means that I will probably not finish it.
