There are many reasons someone would want to have a home server. In this post I want to explain my reasons and how I build / setup everything.

## Privacy and independence

For me there are few main reasons why I wanted to get started with selfhosting. I think my journey began about two years ago in 2022 when I first was playing around with a Synology NAS. This helped me a bit with some of the goals I have. Having a Synology NAS improved my independency especially from big tech and other nightmares and therefore also improved my privacy. But after a while I had a feeling that something wasn't quite right with this setup. First the Synology software is not **Open Source** and therefore there are still **privacy** concerns. Also Synology is a taiwanese company and the situation with China was warring me therefore. (There would be a lot of bigger problems in tech but it was still warring me.)

So the next step was building my own NAS / home server with custom **Open Source** software. I explain this more in depth later in the post. For now just say I build my own server about a year ago in 2023 and now have all my data at home in a environment I trust and am able to control fully. So I achieved a lot of independence of the shady big tech companies.

## Cost

Cost can be advantage or disadvantage if you start to selfhost. On the one side you have to pay for your hardware and electricity your server consumes but on the other side you can cancel a couple of subcriptions which are also pretty expensive. For example are you probably using some sort of cloud storage. (Or at least you should be using something like that in my opinion.) Having a bit of data in such a storage can have high costs. For example buying OneDrive which is included in the MS Personal subscription costs about 6$ a month. Other cloud storages like a hosted Nextcloud might even be more expensive.

But I must admit in my case the cost of selfhosting is not an advantage. But if you are living in country with cheaper elecricity this might differ.

(Just to mention it: OneDrive and a lot of other big tech tools scan your files for illegal content and use filters that might report you to law enforcement. This tools are known to make mistakes and so a image of your child on the beach can lead to your Microsoft account being suspended in the best case and a meeting with the local police in the worst case. Something like that will never happen if you are selfhosting. Be aware!)

## Knowledge

Another good point for having a home lab is all the knowledge you get from it. You have to think about the hardware set everything up physically, you need to learn about RAID, about the operating systems and the software you are running, not to mention security and setting up a safe environment. There is a lot to learn on this journey!

## Helping others

Last but not least I want to mention a small point I think is notable. If you are building all of this for you it is really easy to give a few other people access to the services you are running. So you can help out your friends and family to have a better privacy and generally speaking all of the benefits I was talking about.
