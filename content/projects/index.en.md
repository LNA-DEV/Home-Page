## This Website

I am working on a personal website since march 2021. First I made a custom implementation but nowadays I am using a Hugo theme. Currently it is [Paper Mod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) and in a earlier version I used the [Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) theme. This removed **a lot of** work. I am now able to focus on the content and do not have to bother with design or implementation of the website. This page is Open Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/LNA-DEV/Home-Page).

## Fedodo

[Fedodo](https://fedodo.org) is a decentral social network implementing the ActivityPub standard. It is kind of working but in an unstable state. It is a pretty big project and currently I am not working on it. But I think the whole project is pretty cool. Sadly I just don't have the time...

In [this](/en/posts/projects/whathappenedtofedodo) post I described everything in detail if you are interested.

The project is Open Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fedodo). 

## Preparation for a german IT certificate

While preparing for the german *Fachinformatiker* (*computer science expert*) certificate I published my notes in form of a website. Since than I am maintaining this webpage as an Open Source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fachinformatiker-Prufungsvorbereitung). 

The project is growing relatively big. It has a couple of GitHub-Contributors and a lot of page views. I am writing about it only in German. You can find it under the [Fachinformatiker Prüfungsvorbereitung](/de/tags/fachinformatiker-prüfungsvorbereitung/) tag.

The certificate is german and so is the website. It is called [Fachinformatiker Prüfungsvorbereitung](https://fachinformatikerpruefungsvorbereitung.de/).
