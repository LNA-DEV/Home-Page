## This Website

I am working on a personal website since march 2021. First I made a custom implementation but nowadays I am using a Hugo theme. Currently it is [Paper Mod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) and on a earlier version I used the [Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) theme. This removed **a lot of** work. I am now able to focus on the content and do not have to bother with design or implementation of the website. This page is Open Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/LNA-DEV/Home-Page).

## Fedodo

Fedodo is a decentral social network implementing the ActivityPub standard. It is kind working but in an unstable state. It is a pretty big project and currently I am not working on it. But I think the whole project is pretty cool. Sadly I just don't have the time... The project is Open Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fedodo).

## Preparation for a german IT certificate

While preparing for the german *Fachinformatiker Pr√ºfungsvorbereitung* (*computer science expert*) certificate I published my notes in form of a website. Since than I am maintaining this webpage as an Open Source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fachinformatiker-Prufungsvorbereitung). The certificate is german and so is the website.
