    tagline: "My digital home base"
    description: "I am working on a personal website since march 2021. First I made a custom implementation but nowadays I am using a Hugo theme. Currently it is [Paper Mod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) and in a earlier version I used the [Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) theme. This removed **a lot of** work. I am now able to focus on the content and do not have to bother with design or implementation of the website."
