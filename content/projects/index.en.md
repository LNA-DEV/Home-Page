  - name: This Website
    description: "I am working on a personal website since march 2021. First I made a custom implementation but nowadays I am using a Hugo theme. Currently it is [Paper Mod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) and in a earlier version I used the [Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) theme. This removed **a lot of** work. I am now able to focus on the content and do not have to bother with design or implementation of the website."

  - name: Preparation for a german IT certificate
    description: "While preparing for the german *Fachinformatiker* (*computer science expert*) certificate I published my notes in form of a website. Since than I am maintaining this webpage as an Open Source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fachinformatiker-Prufungsvorbereitung). The project is growing relatively big. It has a couple of GitHub-Contributors and a lot of page views. I am writing about it only in German. You can find it under the [Fachinformatiker Prüfungsvorbereitung](/de/tags/fachinformatiker-prüfungsvorbereitung/) tag. The certificate is german and so is the website. It is called [Fachinformatiker Prüfungsvorbereitung](https://fachinformatikerpruefungsvorbereitung.de/)."
